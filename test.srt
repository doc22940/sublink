00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,869
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,170
Please take your seats
if you haven't already.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,329
The makers of this film wanted me

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,483
to address you before we proceed.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,139
This is a film about sex,

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,813
more specifically sex addiction.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,799
It is probably one of the strangest films

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,883
you will ever see.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,609
I think, it will thrill you.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,999
I know it will shock you.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,159
It may even horrify you.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,403
So, if any of you feel
that you cannot endure it,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,543
please leave now.

14
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:42,685
Well, I warned you.

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,052
Oh, god.

16
00:00:58,942 --> 00:00:59,942
Oh, god.

17
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,172
Jake.

18
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,448
Jake, wake up.

19
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,231
You're not fooling anybody.

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,986
Do you hear it, Jake?

21
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:21,237
I know you can.

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,519
Isn't it beautiful?

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,101
Fuck, fuck, fuck, oh!

24
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,785
Where do you
think it's coming from?

25
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,119
Across the hall?

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,028
The floor above?

27
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:40,858
No, next door.

28
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,313
That's where it's coming from next door.

29
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,929
Jake, come on.

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,593
You know you can't sleep, not now.

31
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,347
Who you tryin' to fool?

32
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,091
Listen.

33
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,454
It's getting louder again.

34
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,080
Listen to it, Jake.

35
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,581
Oh, god.

36
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,507
Listen to it, Jake.

37
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,905
It's like you're right
in there watching them.

38
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,593
You feel how hard your dick is?

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,033
Ah, go into the bathroom.

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,730
That's where it's the loudest.

41
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:07,912
That's it.

42
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,898
Doesn't that feel good?

43
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,009
Closer.

44
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,777
Closer, that's it.

45
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:53,027
Get right up against the wall.

46
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,592
Fuck, that's hot!

47
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:01,379
It's that couple next door.

48
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,043
I bet her pussy's so fucking wet.

49
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:07,133
Don't be jealous enjoy it, that's it.

50
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,847
It's beautiful.

51
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:54,318
Cum with them, that's it.

52
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,319
Oh, fuck.

53
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:00,617
Oh, god.

54
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,388
Time to start the night, Jake.

55
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:09,144
Time to start the night.

56
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,127
Jake, how are you?

57
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
I'm good.

58
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,133
I can't hear you?

59
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,429
I said I'm good.

60
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,130
Wait, I'm gonna come over there.

61
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,213
Where have you been?

62
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:20,093
I haven't seen you since you
helped me with my cabinets.

63
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,263
I've just been keeping busy.

64
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,430
Doing what?

65
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,093
Just things.

66
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,523
How's your sister?

67
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,170
She's good.

68
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,749
She's coming back tonight, actually.

69
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,573
That's great, you must be excited.

70
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,233
Yeah, I am.

71
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,613
Are you still in school?

72
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,143
We're on break.

73
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,140
Still?

74
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,139
I hate to do this to
you, I hate to be rude,

75
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,789
but I actually have a lot of
stuff to do, if you don't mind.

76
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,339
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,853
Yeah, it's really late, sorry.

78
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,089
You know, I'm sure you
have a really, really

79
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,633
long night ahead of you.

80
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,749
But if you have any time,

81
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,100
why don't you come by my
apartment and fuck me?

82
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,229
I know you're getting
ready to fuck your sister.

84
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,443
You know, she's a slut.

85
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Jake.

86
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,210
Jake.

87
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,450
Yeah.

88
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I said why don't you come
by and visit me tomorrow?

89
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,810
I have a leaky pipe that I
could use some help with.

90
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,853
You know, how much I
don't like to call Felix.

91
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, tomorrow I'll stop by.

92
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,610
Have a good night.

93
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,473
Okay, have a good night.

94
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,599
Jake, we left a
little bit of money for you,

95
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,003
and dad left you a gift.

96
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,879
Love, mom and dad.

97
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,453
Awe, isn't that nice, Jake?

98
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,650
Let's see what your dad got you.

99
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,467
Wow, look at that thing.

100
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:35,574
What are you gonna do with that, Jake?

101
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,399
Stop messing around.

102
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Let's get started.

103
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,560
Hi, I'm calling
about the $200 special.

104
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:02,213
It's tonight only, right?

105
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,853
Yeah, I'm 21.

106
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,429
I live on 14th Street.

107
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,730
It's the Village East End.

108
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,107
Yeah, I live on the fifth floor, room 503.

109
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,790
Alright, see you soon, bye.

110
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:33,623
Hi.

111
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:34,456
Hi.

112
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:35,350
Uh, you can come on in.

113
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:39,239
Thank you.

114
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,289
You can put, uh...

115
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,321
You can take your boots off
and sit down, if you want.

116
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,529
Thanks.

117
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,430
I'm Veronica.

118
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,829
I'm Jake, hi.

119
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,153
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

120
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:07,665
So.

121
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:11,995
Wanna get started.

122
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't bite.

123
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,533
So, what do you want?

124
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,050
I'm not sure.

125
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,320
I wanna do everything to you.

126
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,683
Well, I'm fetish friendly.

127
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,740
Do you have any fetishes?

128
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,920
I want you to put your foot in my mouth.

129
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,170
Okay.

130
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,850
Does that feel good, baby brother?

131
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Stop.

132
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,772
What's wrong?

133
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:28,759
Get on top of me.

134
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,983
Sure.

135
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:32,092
All right.

136
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,079
You're so good, Jake.

137
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,412
You're the best.

138
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,843
Spank me, Jake.

139
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,331
Spank me harder!

140
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:14,694
Harder!

141
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:18,177
Cum on my face.

142
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,430
Sorry, if I got your
bed a little bit messy.

143
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,710
Um, is that for me?

144
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,097
Oh, yeah, that's for you.

145
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,531
Thanks.

146
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Thank you.

147
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,348
Have a good night.

148
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,016
Have a good night.

149
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,499
What's the matter, Jake?

150
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,600
Wondering what games I'm playing with you?

151
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,209
Wondering why you're seeing
your sister during sex?

152
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,313
It's quite simple.

153
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,773
We need something more.

154
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,889
I'm talking about a greater high,

155
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,483
something so fucked up
but it feels so good.

156
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,153
Where are you going?

157
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,883
This won't do.

158
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,163
The usual's not gonna be enough anymore.

159
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,100
You're going to be disappointed.

160
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Can I help you?

161
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,999
Yeah, I was wondering
if I could have a session?

162
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,463
Did you schedule an appointment?

163
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,470
No, but I have money.

164
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,690
How old are you?

165
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
22.

166
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,470
Can I see your ID?

167
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,310
Yeah.

168
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,409
All right.

169
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,410
Come on in.

170
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,263
Take your shoes off.

171
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,810
I take my money upfront.

172
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,983
It's the $100 special today only, right?

173
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
That's right.

174
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,559
Alright, baby, couple of ground rules

175
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,209
to go over before we get started.

176
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,539
This session is for one hour.

177
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,033
When the hour is over, you must go.

178
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,479
Um, as far as, me I'm open to anything,

179
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,163
golden showers, pegging,
everything is fair game to me.

180
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,409
You can pick your own safe word.

181
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,103
I don't want a safe word.

182
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,319
Baby, I think...

183
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Trust me.

184
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,099
Alright, well, I wasn't expecting you,

185
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,159
so I have to get into custom.

186
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,223
But I'll be right back.

187
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,380
Make yourself at home.

188
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,453
Jake, what are you doing here?

189
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,133
Why waste your money?

190
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,693
This isn't good enough anymore.

191
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,833
She's not Molly, Jake.

192
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,583
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

193
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,513
Can't you see what I'm trying to do?

194
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,590
I'm talking about something better.

195
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,423
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you, Jake.

196
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,470
You believe me, don't you, Jake?

197
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,739
Alright, have your fun.

198
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,669
But this won't change anything.

199
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,670
You'll see.

200
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,833
I'm not going away, Jake.

201
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I promise you that.

202
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,190
Have you been a bad boy?

203
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,570
Yes, mistress.

204
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,489
Take your shirt off.

205
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,839
Yes, mistress.

206
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,023
Throw it on the floor.

207
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,520
Yes, mistress.

208
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,603
Get on your knees.

209
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,507
Yes, mistress.

210
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,420
So, you've been a bad boy?

211
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,420
Yes, mistress.

212
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,749
And you're a dirty little bitch,

213
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,263
who needs to be punished!

214
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,883
- Yes, mistress!
- Say it!

215
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,929
I'm a dirty little bitch,

216
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,023
who needs to be punished!

217
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,432
Good.

218
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,100
You don't mind this, do you?

219
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:49,460
You like it, don't you?

220
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,562
Oh, yeah.

221
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,730
Yes, mistress.

222
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:02,915
Ah, ah, ah.

223
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,963
Fucking pathetic.

224
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:09,393
Yes, mistress.

225
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,012
Yes, mistress, louder!

226
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:13,841
Yes, mistress!

227
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:16,326
Oh, I'm sorry does that hurt?

228
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,160
Does that hurt?

229
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:18,327
- Oh.
- Oh.

230
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,765
I'm gonna have fun with you.

231
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,778
Yes, mistress.

232
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,352
Yes, mistress, louder!

233
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,769
Yes, mistress!
- I can't fucking hear you,

234
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,819
you pathetic piece of shit.

235
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Yes, mistress!

236
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:49,979
Are you ready to be punished, slave?

237
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,910
- Oh, yes, mistress!
- I can't fucking hear you!

238
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:54,244
Yes, mistress!

239
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,939
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't get you off,

240
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,103
but you just didn't seem that into it.

241
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:15,644
It's all right.

242
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,890
BDSM isn't for everybody.

243
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,190
It wasn't my first time.

244
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:32,951
Bye.

245
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,503
See, Jake, what did I tell you?

246
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,083
We need something new, something more,

247
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,409
the ultimate high, your sister Jake.

248
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,919
You're supposed to pick her up, right?

249
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,519
That's perfect.

250
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,999
Come on go see your sister, Jake.

251
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Jake.

252
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,429
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,879
Jake?

254
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
Yeah.

255
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:08,749
You don't remember us,

256
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,283
Elizabeth, Chris, Korab from school?

257
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Oh, yeah.

258
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:16,929
How have you guys been?

259
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,519
Better than you, at
least by the looks of it.

260
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,737
Yeah, what the hell
happened to your eye, man?

261
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,113
Oh, it's a long story.

262
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,294
What are you guys up to though?

263
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,600
We were just
gonna go grab something.

264
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:29,670
You come with us.

265
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,660
I was about to...

266
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,057
I was about to go somewhere.

267
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,141
Come on.

268
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,440
Neither of you are gonna ask him

269
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,840
why he just blew us all off?

270
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,559
I mean, look, I don't wanna
start any shit in a restaurant,

271
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,343
but we have a right to know.

272
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,650
What do you wanna know?

273
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,699
We wanna know why you just
stopped coming to school?

274
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,059
Why you just dropped out
without telling anyone,

275
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,009
not your professors, not your friends,

276
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,889
not me, who I thought
was your best friend,

277
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,199
not even Monica, bro,

278
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
Monica, your fucking girlfriend?

279
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,849
It's one thing to treat us like dog shit,

280
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,113
but your girlfriend, that's fucked up.

281
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,859
And if neither of them
were gonna say anything,

282
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,439
then I had to let you know
how disrespectful that was

283
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,190
to the people that thought
they meant something to you.

284
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,799
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

285
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,293
I mean, tell me at least you
had a good reason for all it.

286
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:10,940
All I can say is I had my reasons.

287
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,985
If that's not good enough,

288
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,489
I don't know what to tell you.

289
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,684
That's all you have to say?

290
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:20,649
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

291
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,923
This fucking guy, man.

292
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:26,646
I don't know.

293
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,413
I don't know what you guys want me to say.

294
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:30,664
Are you okay?

295
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:34,349
I mean, yeah, my eye.

296
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,449
No, it's not just your eye.

297
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,850
Frankly, you look like shit.

298
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,803
What's the real reason you
dropped out of school, drugs?

299
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:48,260
I just wanted other things.

300
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,059
Hey, Jake.

301
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,860
I remembered this was your favorite.

302
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,459
Why don't you come lick it off me?

303
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,460
Jake.

304
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,732
Yeah.

305
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,733
Korab, was right.

306
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,090
Something happened to you.

307
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,900
Don't worry about them.

308
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,370
Don't worry about your
bitch of an ex, Jake.

309
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,893
Didn't you hear?

310
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,194
She's with some other guy.

311
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:26,075
You're different, Jake, embrace it.

312
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,210
Jake, don't.

313
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,143
Jake don't remember her.

314
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,213
Think about Molly.

315
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,893
Embrace the high.

316
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,923
Tell me a secret.

317
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:58,887
I feel like I'm the
luckiest guy in the world.

318
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:04,674
Awe.

319
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,159
Tell me a lie.

320
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,989
I don't think
you're the cutest boy I know.

321
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,990
Cute.

322
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,169
What's the matter with hot?

323
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,963
Come on cute's cute, and you're cute.

324
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:26,440
I mean, I guess, I'll take it.

325
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,773
Tell me a lie.

326
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,763
I don't
love you or your family.

327
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:38,479
You're not even trying.

328
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,203
What can I say, I'm a happy guy.

329
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,853
Tell me a secret.

330
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,713
I wanna have your kids.

331
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,363
Really?

332
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,919
Uh-huh.

333
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,449
How many will we have?

334
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,163
Let's see, um,

335
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,802
a boy.

336
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,189
Definitely.

337
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,190
Shut up.

338
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,349
A boy and two girls.

339
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,393
Three kids?

340
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,923
I mean, I guess, I better
get started on that boy.

341
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,459
It's so the brother can look
after his siblings, you know?

342
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,060
Or in my case the sister
look out for her brother.

343
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,199
That sounds good to me.

344
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll be there.

345
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,023
Good, 'cause I wouldn't
want you anywhere else.

346
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,990
I don't know if I can
do this anymore, Jake.

347
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,190
What do you mean?

348
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:50,149
All you wanna do is watch porn.

349
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,369
I mean, we can't even make
love like a regular couple

350
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,320
because it doesn't get your off enough.

351
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,029
What's wrong with fucking with a porno

352
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,739
on in the background?

353
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,799
I'm just trying to spice things up.

354
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,509
That's my point.

355
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,779
You never used to call it fucking.

356
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,779
It was always making love.

357
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,949
Making love, fucking
what's the difference?

358
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,439
There is a difference, Jake.

359
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,789
You used to like making love to me,

360
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,913
and now all you wanna do is fuck.

361
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,683
Yeah, it's me Jake.

362
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:05,993
I know it's been a while.

363
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,983
Can I come see you?

364
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,073
I got a lot on my mind.

365
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,563
I think, you can help.

366
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,489
Alright, I'll be over soon.

367
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,407
Sorry about the mess.

368
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,558
It was my two siblings.

369
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,299
I share the room with them

370
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,650
till I get back on my feet.

371
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,939
No, that's fine.

372
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,540
So how the hell you been, man?

373
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,110
I haven't seen you in forever.

374
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,860
I'm actually not doin' so good.

375
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,359
Just about to ask you about your eye.

376
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,714
What happened, you got jumped
on the way here or what?

377
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,249
Oh, yeah, my eye it's nothing.

378
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't worry about it.

379
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,451
You not back in the life?

380
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,597
Jake, come on, man.

381
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:54,598
How long?

382
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,640
Been back in for a while.

383
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:01,470
I should've known I haven't seen you

384
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,820
at the meetings in a while.

385
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,873
What you want me to sponsor
you back and get you in, what?

386
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,790
No, I was actually hoping you had

387
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,499
had something to sort me out.

388
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Sort you out?

389
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,325
You mean like pills?

390
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,430
Yeah, I need something, man.

391
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:22,519
Let me see.

392
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,270
Now describe to me what's going on.

393
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,579
Well, it's like I can't
control my thoughts.

394
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,209
It's like my brain is trying
to get me to do crazier

395
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,863
and crazier sexual shit,
shit I would never do.

396
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,999
I can't get off otherwise.

397
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,033
Yeah, it's a sexual high.

398
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:43,527
The brain is a funny thing, my friend.

399
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:44,963
Here take this.

400
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,113
What is it?

401
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,483
It's some good shit.

402
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,709
I'm a hit it myself, and it's as small

403
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,010
as an everyday.

404
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,582
Yeah, but you haven't
told me what it is.

405
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,033
It's a form of psychedelic.

406
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,369
You'll see some weird shit.

407
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,197
But it'll stop your mind
from fuckin' with you

408
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,309
even for a little bit.

409
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,810
Yeah, listen, that's the
best I can do, my friend.

410
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,379
Alright, man, I really appreciate it.

411
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,031
Yeah, don't worry about it.

412
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,052
I don't have much money to pay you.

413
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,040
Man, don't worry about it.

414
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,439
This is on the house.

415
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,430
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

416
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,481
Now where you headed?

417
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,069
I was thinking about heading down to...

418
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,170
I was thinking headin' over to the Bowery.

419
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
The fucking bar.

420
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,973
Jake, why would you wanna go down there?

421
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:43,578
You know you only hurting yourself, right?

422
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,469
Hey, man, listen I
really do appreciate this,

423
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,470
the stuff, I mean.

424
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,207
It was good seeing you.

425
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,942
I think, I'm gonna be out though.

426
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,149
Alright,
Jake, take it easy man.

427
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,744
Don't be a stranger, okay?

428
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,342
All right.

429
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,599
Alright, thanks again.

430
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,569
Hey, Jake, you be safe, man.

431
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,280
Take care of yourself.

432
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,293
Doesn't that feel good, baby?

433
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Talent Show.

434
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,083
I can see we have a packed house tonight.

435
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,469
Either way, let's get this
show on the road, huh?

436
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,459
I'm going to bring out your
first contestant of the evening.

437
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,269
Her talent is singing,

438
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,579
and she's recently single.

439
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,483
You know what that means
guys, especially you.

440
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Please give a nice round
of applause for Ms. Molly.

441
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:10,189
Thank you.

442
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,977
One more time a nice round of applause

443
00:48:11,978 --> 00:48:14,036
for the lovely Ms. Molly.

444
00:48:17,148 --> 00:48:19,065
Singing about swinging.

445
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,503
Now who's our next lucky contestant?

446
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,879
How about you, sir?

447
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,959
Would you like to come on up
here and show us your talent?

448
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
What's your name?

449
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,559
It's Jake.

450
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,659
Jake.

451
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,713
Take it away.

452
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,850
How's everybody doin'?

453
00:48:52,191 --> 00:48:55,691
I'm not really good at this sort of thing.

454
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:58,025
I'm not sure what I should do.

455
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:05,171
Do you sing?

456
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,150
No, I don't.

457
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,100
You don't have to sing.

458
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,970
What's your talent?

459
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,380
I don't really have one.

460
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,763
Sure you do.

461
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,430
Your cock.

462
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,603
Show them your cock.

463
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,140
It's why you're here, isn't it?

464
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,463
Ladies and gentlemen, once
again give it up for Jake.

465
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:15,491
Tough crowd, huh?

466
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,412
Listen, Jake.

467
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:26,710
Silence!

468
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:31,299
We have a consolation prize for you,

469
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,700
something that'll make
you feel a little better.

470
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,069
Come here, Jake.

471
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,679
Come to me.

472
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,680
Come on.

473
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,129
Come on, Jake.

474
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,599
You know you want to.

475
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Come to me.

476
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,555
Hey, man, are you okay?

477
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:11,093
You seem a little spaced out.

478
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,090
Come with me there's
something I think you'll like.

479
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,787
How you ladies doin'?

480
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:04,623
What do we have here?

481
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,833
Who's this?

482
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,119
He's my friend?

483
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,173
Does he speak?

484
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,319
He's a little fucked up.

485
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,919
I don't know what drugs he took,

486
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,320
but he's not doin' too good.

487
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,149
He just needs you ladies to wake him up.

488
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,769
We can do that.

489
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,770
Right girls?

490
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,100
Definitely.

491
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,023
Against the wall.

492
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,673
Take off your jacket and your shirt.

493
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,459
See this whip.

494
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,710
We gonna use this on you.

495
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,723
Turn around.

496
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,151
How does that feel?

497
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,523
Feels good.

498
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,732
Is this what you want?

499
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:03,923
Yes.

500
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,660
Say it.

501
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:07,744
Yes!

502
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:10,607
You like being dominated by three women?

503
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,779
Yes, I do.

504
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,374
You like being our property?

505
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,525
Yes!

506
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,500
Good.

507
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,352
Now hit her.

508
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,023
Hit her now, slave.

509
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,490
Harder!

510
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,463
Now let's put him in his place.

511
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:59,332
You are weak.

512
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,333
Weak.

513
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,493
You are helpless.

514
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,533
Nobody can save you.

515
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:10,157
Look at him.

516
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,589
Hey, it's just me.

517
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,439
I guess you forget to
pick me up at the station.

518
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,433
Don't worry I won't tell mom.

519
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,069
I'm headed to the hotel to
unpack and get settled in.

520
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,720
You should definitely come
by later if you have time.

521
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:41,869
I texted you the address and the number.

522
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,229
Hope to see you soon.

523
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,533
Love you, bye.

524
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,260
Wild night, huh?

525
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
Yeah.

526
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,110
Who was that on the phone?

527
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,460
Girlfriend doesn't know
about your other life.

528
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,180
It was my sister, actually.

529
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:09,243
Even better.

530
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
I'm Erdy.

531
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,250
Jake.

532
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,507
Saw you in there.

533
00:58:24,051 --> 00:58:25,851
You seemed to be having a good time.

534
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,640
How long you been coming here?

535
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,879
A while.

536
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,880
Yeah, me too.

537
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:36,494
I like it here.

538
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:39,827
You can pretty much find
anything you want here.

539
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,723
I like finding new people.

540
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,100
How come I didn't, uh...

541
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:56,449
How come I didn't see you
engaging with the others?

542
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,883
Sex really isn't my thing.

543
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:01,693
After a while,

544
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,259
your mind picks something
that really gets you

545
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,260
and itself off.

546
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:10,999
It sticks with it,

547
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,008
at least that's what I think anyway.

548
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,880
What's your thing?

549
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:23,967
Well,

550
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,108
you could follow me and find out.

551
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Follow you where?

552
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:38,433
I got a place near here.

553
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,750
You wanna walk over there with me?

554
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
All right.

555
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,993
No, no this way.

556
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:00,813
Shelly, this is?

557
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,789
- Jake.
- Jake.

558
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,151
Jake, Shelly.

559
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:08,149
Oh, what a handsome young man.

560
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,839
Yeah, isn't he?

561
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,889
Can I get you anything, Jake?

562
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,213
Nah, I'm fine.

563
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,923
So, if you don't mind my asking,

564
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,210
what am I doing here?

565
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,963
Isn't it obvious?

566
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,883
You're gonna fuck my wife,

567
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,143
and I'm gonna watch.

568
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:42,273
Oh, he's shy.

569
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,769
Why don't you put on some music?

570
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,519
Great idea.

571
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,970
Anything in particular, Jake?

572
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,540
It's like the perfect balance
between joy and sadness.

573
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:40,679
Well,

574
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,423
Jake, let's get started.

575
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,177
You don't have to worry, Jake.

576
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,678
Nobody's gonna judge you here.

577
01:02:11,886 --> 01:02:13,429
Now pull her to face me.

578
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,263
I wanna see my slut wife's face.

579
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,320
Pull her, pull her hair back.

580
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:24,442
Yeah.

581
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:30,876
Now start fucking her.

582
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,242
Hard.

583
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,015
Harder.

584
01:02:44,016 --> 01:02:45,430
Harder.

585
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:46,431
Harder.

586
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:48,309
Harder.

587
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,973
Fuck my slut wife harder.

588
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,085
Yeah.

589
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,830
Jake, look at you.

590
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,339
You didn't think a pill and a Coke

591
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,373
will keep me away for good, did you?

592
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:37,899
You know what you have to do.

593
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,983
Now go do it.

594
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,183
Go in and take a peek, Jake.

595
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:19,663
You know you want to.

596
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,809
Jake, don't feel guilty.

597
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,563
It's going to feel so good.

598
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,420
Awe, it's gonna be the ultimate high.

599
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:42,459
Hey.

600
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,263
Baby brother, hi.

601
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,799
You left the door open.

602
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,450
Yeah, I figured you might come.

603
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,918
How did you know?

604
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,609
Well, who wouldn't
wanna see his big sister

605
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,433
after two whole years.

606
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:04,943
How do I look?

607
01:06:08,204 --> 01:06:09,669
You look good.

608
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,729
Yeah, I lost 10 pounds
since you last saw me.

609
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,199
Okay, let me go get changed.

610
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,449
I'll be right back.

611
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,016
Oh, my god!

612
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,870
I can't believe I'm finally
back in New York City.

613
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,540
She does look
good, doesn't she, Jake.

614
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:30,397
You should've taken a peek earlier.

615
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,043
I bet she looks good naked.

616
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,343
No, Jake, we're not going anywhere.

617
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,559
Don't even think about leaving.

618
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,583
We're too close now.

619
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,319
I tell you Colorado so boring.

620
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,403
I can't believe I moved
out there for that asshole.

621
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,520
Hey, what's wrong?

622
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:08,172
Nothing I...

623
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:10,959
I just have a headache, all right.

624
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,143
Oh, okay.

625
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,260
Well,

626
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
come sit with me.

627
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:24,083
So, little brother, what's new with you?

628
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:31,343
Nothing much, just keeping busy.

629
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,379
Okay.

630
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,323
Did you fuck any cute girls lately?

631
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,659
What?

632
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,523
Were any of them as cute as me?

633
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,029
Why do you wanna know that?

634
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,829
You know why
she wants to know that?

635
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,163
It's just a question.

636
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,139
I'm sorry to hear that
you and Monica split up.

637
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,683
She was so pretty.

638
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,460
How long were you two together?

639
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,640
Eight months.

640
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,943
Wow, that's a pretty long time.

641
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,229
Well, I guess we're both single now

642
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,969
first me and Greg,

643
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,193
then you and Monica.

644
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,930
Why'd you guys break up anyway?

645
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,317
Let's talk about you.

646
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:26,500
What are you gonna do now
that you're back in the city?

647
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:27,606
I'm not sure.

648
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:30,793
Probably go try to get
laid, first and foremost.

649
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,199
See, I told you.

650
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,500
Are you fucking with me?

651
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,150
No.

652
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,659
Oh, wait, I almost forget.

653
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,660
I almost forget.

654
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,233
I got you something.

655
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:50,963
Happy belated birthday.

656
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,510
Thanks.

657
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,110
Well, open it.

658
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,249
Wanna know why it's blank?

659
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:30,113
So you can get started on the
next great American novel.

660
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,210
I don't write anymore.

661
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:40,639
Oh.

662
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,363
Really, why not?

663
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:46,303
I just lost the passion.

664
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,413
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something to do with it.

665
01:09:56,544 --> 01:09:59,044
What did mom and dad give you?

666
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,330
Mom gave me money,

667
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:14,373
and dad he gave me his hunting knife.

668
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,493
Dad and his hunting.

669
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:22,469
Yeah, I bet he probably
missing you out there.

670
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,308
Look at her neck.

671
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:25,309
Doesn't that look good?

672
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,153
I'm so mixed up right now.

673
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:34,770
I should leave.

674
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,209
If I stay, something bad's gonna happen.

675
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:43,513
Jake, what do you mean?

676
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,693
I can't control myself.

677
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,850
Feel your dick getting hard?

678
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:55,666
Jake.

679
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:56,590
You want it.

680
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,373
You want it 'cause I want it.

681
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:01,937
You smell good.

682
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,174
Well, thank you.

683
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:12,203
But, Jake, you're really freaking me out.

684
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,310
Embrace it, embrace the high.

685
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,070
I'm sorry.

686
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
I love you.

687
01:11:26,473 --> 01:11:28,349
I'm really sorry I have to do this.

688
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,350
Do what?

689
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:32,490
Jake.

690
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,059
I just can't control myself.

691
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,363
What do you mean?

692
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,533
Jake.

693
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:38,713
I'm sorry I have to.

694
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:42,099
You have to understand.

695
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,963
I have to.
- Jake, what are you doing?

696
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,269
Jake.

697
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,619
Jake, stop it.

698
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,460
Jake.

699
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:52,675
Jake!

700
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,615
Stop it, Jake!

701
01:11:54,616 --> 01:11:56,575
Jake, get off!

702
01:11:56,576 --> 01:11:58,639
Jake, stop it!

703
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,640
Jake!

704
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:01,679
Jake!

705
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:20,841
Jake, stop it!

706
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:22,259
Stop it, stop it!

707
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:26,129
Jake, stop it.

708
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:14,379
No.

709
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,244
I love Monica.

710
01:15:36,219 --> 01:15:37,534
Fuck my wife.

711
01:15:37,535 --> 01:15:38,504
You just blew us all off.

712
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:40,086
Everybody's got secrets.

713
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,370
Wanna fuck me?

714
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,037
What do you want?

715
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:58,180
Monica.

716
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,993
Monica, you in here?

717
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:53,230
Jake.

718
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,143
What are you doing here?

719
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,532
Monica.

720
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:03,850
I miss you.

721
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,039
Jake, you really shouldn't be here.

722
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,819
I have to tell you something.

723
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,113
You have to listen to me.

724
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:16,023
I'm fucked up.

725
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,379
All I think about is sex.

726
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,159
I can't stop it.

727
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,683
I've done some bad things.

728
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,023
Tonight I did something I can't take back.

729
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,863
I raped Molly.

730
01:17:41,006 --> 01:17:42,006
What?

731
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,797
I don't know why I did it.

732
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,870
I can't help myself.

733
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,413
I can't control myself.

734
01:17:51,116 --> 01:17:52,766
I think, I wanted to hurt myself.

735
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,621
Jake, I don't know what's going on,

736
01:17:57,622 --> 01:17:59,079
and I don't know what you did.

737
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,199
But, you clearly need help,

738
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,938
and I can't be a part of it.

739
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:06,989
Monica, I don't feel anything anymore.

740
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,639
Jake, I have to go.

741
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,139
Are you okay, who is this guy?

742
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,323
It's just my ex.

743
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,230
No, I'm fine.

744
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,790
What's done is done, Jake.

745
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,660
Tomorrow you will wake up,

746
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,920
and we will do it all again

747
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,613
just like we always do.

748
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,170
This is who we are now.

749
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:46,937
Everybody's left you,

750
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,157
all these people in these photos,

751
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:54,928
everybody you've ever known,

752
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:57,672
everybody but me.

753
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:31,040
And I will always be
with you, Jake, always.
