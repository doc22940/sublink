1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,710
all right well I've been sitting at my

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,790
desk kind of putting off starting this

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,679
stream for about the last 15 minutes but

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,820
I guess I'm just gonna get on with it so

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,770
we kind of talked about this on land

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,039
show but there's been a little bit of

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,109
drama and then as of today there's been

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,010
more drama around Linus Media Group -

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,439
tech tips me personally whatever sort of

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,510
whatever entity you want to focus your

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,340
Ire at running out and copyright striking

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,840
other content creators and so I typed

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
myself up some notes here to hopefully

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,930
address this and lay it to rest once and

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,370
for all so when it comes to I guess the

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,789
first thing I want to do is sort of ask

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,629
our community the broader YouTube

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,199
community in general just people ask

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,880
them to try to think critically anytime

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
they run up against some kind of

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,390
accusation like I'm not saying that you

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,070
know all accusations should be dismissed

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,600
I'm just also not saying that all

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,810
accusations should be taken entirely at

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,310
face value and then just run with so

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,420
here are some of the questions that I

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,610
would probably ask myself if I were to

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,710
encounter any sort of any sort of drama

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,350
not just YouTube drama who are the

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,570
stakeholders here what do they

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,590
individually stand to lose or gain what

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,490
is the actual solution to this problem

33
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,920
who has the power to enact that solution

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
where could I find more information

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,560
about what's going on

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
is it worth the time that I'm investing

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,840
to find that information in the case of

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,189
the particular thing that's going on

39
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,899
where people are receiving content ID

40
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,759
notifications not to be confused with a

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,500
copyright strike I'll talk about that

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,289
later

43
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,670
but in the case of people receiving

44
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,450
these Content ID notification

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,209
has anyone have these people actually

46
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,920
contacted - Media Group about it

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,530
directly we actually have a contact us

48
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,510
email on our corporate website we also

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,760
have a contact us email for a Linus tech tips

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,650
specifically on our YouTube channel that

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,750
stuff does get monitored on business

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,340
days mind you like this is my long

53
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,349
weekend it's family day here in British

54
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,650
Columbia but I'm dealing with this

55
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,330
instead of doing what I would really

56
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,760
much rather be doing um here are some

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,170
here are some other questions we can ask

58
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,150
ourselves whenever we encounter drama

59
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,819
what else is already posted in the

60
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,269
comments on the video is there something

61
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,799
with a ton of upvotes that sort of

62
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,870
answers my question am I being

63
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,480
manipulated to join a crusade is the is

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,310
it based on ignorance or is there some

65
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,519
kind of agenda so those are all the just

66
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,380
general questions that I'd really like

67
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,480
people to ask themselves whenever they

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,480
are sort of called to join a cause with

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,950
the most important ones I think being

70
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,170
who are the stakeholders what do they

71
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,569
stand to lose and gain what is the

72
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,000
actual solution and what could or has

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
already been done about it and then for

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,590
for myself personally this has been

75
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,790
there's been kind of frustrating

76
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,319
offensive hurtful I'm you know there's a

77
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,579
bunch of different words for it because

78
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,200
the the questions that I'd like you guys

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,079
to ask yourselves about me and and my

80
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,870
company specifically is is Linus Media

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,260
Group some kind of monster that's not

82
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,959
still run by real people who give a

83
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,410
as opposed to you know some nameless

84
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,299
faceless corporation like yeah we're

85
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,120
we're on the bigger side especially of

86
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
tech YouTube channels but that doesn't

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,530
mean that like we've worked hard to get

88
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,470
here it's not like it we got there by

89
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,299
being you know jerks or anything we

90
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,310
haven't you know engaged in market

91
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,079
manipulation or any other unfair

92
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,420
competitive practice you know another

93
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,880
question to ask yourself is is the

94
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,040
behavior that Linus media groups being

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,810
accused of or - personally is being

96
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,530
accused of is that in character is Linus

97
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,579
Pro censorship does he silence criticism

98
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,450
is there is that behavior that anyone

99
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,040
has actually encountered

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,830
from us in the past and if we haven't

101
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,650
then you know is it may be worthwhile to

102
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,290
give the benefit of the doubt

103
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,900
so all right now we're we're past sort

104
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,840
of the the preface to the stream so

105
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
let's get into some of the points that

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,730
I've more completely prepared I was like

107
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,530
sitting inside my car having sort of

108
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,330
scrolled soot scroll through some

109
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,890
comments on the forum some comments on

110
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,840
YouTube I'm trying to figure out sort of

111
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
what I need to address so I wrote myself

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,370
up kind of a little script here but of

113
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,760
course it's all in it's all my own words

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,140
just a few guys see me kind of looking

115
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,760
down it's because I'm looking at this at

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,990
the screen I'm just dreaming this awful

117
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,050
webcam at my house so here's the deal

118
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,730
look I think I just shook the camera

119
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,550
sorry about that guys so I'm not gonna

120
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,220
be naming any of the individuals that

121
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,530
are stirring the pot here because my

122
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,570
general policy when it comes to public

123
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,510
drama is one of zero acknowledgement

124
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,500
like if there's a legitimate grievance

125
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,320
no problem get in touch we'll do our

126
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,940
best to solve it I think we have a

127
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,460
pretty good reputation not just among

128
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,710
viewers but within the creator community

129
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,620
as being an organization like not just

130
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,530
me of course it's there's 20 plus people

131
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,570
that work at Linus Media Group but being

132
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,890
an organization that just generally

133
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,260
cares about fixing problems and doing

134
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,540
the right thing I mean an example of

135
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,100
sort of our zero acknowledgement like

136
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,830
you you just you won't you won't hear

137
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,660
from us about this stuff I feel like I

138
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,760
can bring up this one now because it's

139
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,240
sort of not relevant anymore but we had

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
an issue with totalbiscuit at one point

141
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,420
where after having a relationship in the

142
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,800
past we had him on the way on show at

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,320
one point he put me and Luc personally

144
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,080
on blast publicly over something that

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,920
was posted by a user on our forum and

146
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,080
that was instead of contacting either me

147
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,320
or Luc directly and the really bizarre

148
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,720
thing about that was that I know a

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,420
hundred percent that he had my email

150
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,630
since he had no problem asking for and

151
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,780
even receiving multiple times text

152
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,420
or from me and then like when I reached

153
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,670
out directly rather than replying on

154
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,810
Twitter because I'm not going to do that

155
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,100
when I reached out directly like yo WTF

156
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,889
can you retract your comments publicly

157
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,830
cuz that's really unfair like this this

158
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,510
is a user comment on our forum you

159
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,610
didn't even you didn't even contact us

160
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,280
and asked us to have it dealt with he

161
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,290
basically said and I'm paraphrasing here

162
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,760
I didn't feel like pulling up the email

163
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,190
cuz it was really annoying he basically

164
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,070
said like I don't get why you expect me

165
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,390
to reach out to you directly we're not

166
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,100
friends and you need to moderate your

167
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,110
forum better our subreddit is moderated

168
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,669
you're responsible for the content on

169
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,190
your forum I'm kind of sitting here

170
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,450
going what are you even talking about

171
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,350
like at its peak your subreddit was a

172
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,360
small fraction of our forum we have like

173
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,220
a really really debt it like massive

174
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,960
shout-out to our forum moderators we

175
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,870
have a dedicated community over there

176
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,720
and it's a lot of work what they do to

177
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,600
keep the Linus tech tips forum running

178
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,280
they're amazing they do a great job and

179
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,810
you go after my moderators who tell me

180
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,419
they're you know they're subpar just

181
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,280
because someone posted something that

182
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,650
was offensive to you but not necessarily

183
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,850
even against our Community Guidelines

184
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,830
actually don't remember exactly what the

185
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,800
post was but like yeah he went on the

186
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,410
list you never saw another

187
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,690
acknowledgement from Linus media group

188
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,840
because that's that's the way that's the

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,620
way to me things should work that's the

190
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,570
way my engagement with people on the

191
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,850
internet works because that's how my

192
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,160
human relationships works so whether

193
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,350
it's my household my friends my family

194
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,550
my company

195
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,250
these are drama-free zones and if you

196
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,050
can't abide by those rules if you can't

197
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,419
stay drama-free then I am well within my

198
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:31,270
rights to completely ignore you and the

199
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,820
funny thing is like like we've we try to

200
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,690
like we do that in an effort to try and

201
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,729
take the high road and a lot of the time

202
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,770
I feel like we end up looking bad

203
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,680
because other people get their shots in

204
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,459
at us and we just we just never return

205
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,370
fire like it's not like I've never had

206
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,430
personal you know beef to use the lingo

207
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,980
I suppose with other content creators

208
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,340
but here's the thing I guarantee you

209
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,190
don't know who they are because anyone

210
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,340
that I have actually feuded with

211
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,920
publicly like Jays two cents or Steve

212
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,870
from gamers Nexus trying to beat their

213
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,880
benchmark scores or Paul and Kyle

214
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,710
ripping their award away from them at

215
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,630
the end of scrapyard Wars or Louis

216
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,360
Rossman with the whole you know baking a

217
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,310
GPU and oh wow you really shouldn't do

218
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,620
that Linus he said it a little more

219
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,940
colorfully than that but the point is

220
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,630
the point is anyone that I have publicly

221
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,940
feuded with or beefed with I both like

222
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,370
and respect in private like these are

223
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,130
people that I would sit down and have a

224
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,780
drink without a trade show not that I

225
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,550
drink but yeah I can have water they can

226
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,780
have something stronger whatever works

227
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,220
for them I'm not actually monitoring

228
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,140
chat right now cuz I'm reading my thing

229
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,380
but hopefully the stream is like working

230
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,550
properly and stuff you know it seems

231
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,950
like it's fine so back to the question

232
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,340
of agendas this is the most important

233
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,620
thing to think about again I'm not gonna

234
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,810
be naming any names for reasons that

235
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,760
I've explained already but I will say

236
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,800
that at least one individual out there

237
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,620
who has drawn attention to the matter of

238
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:19,920
these Linus tech tips Content ID flags

239
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,210
okay so this person rather than simply

240
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,190
disputing the claims and don't bother

241
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,960
speculating about who it is because

242
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,880
there's so many people that are

243
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,380
complaining about it at this point and

244
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,330
I'll get into why there's a bunch of

245
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,770
people complaining about these Content

246
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,660
ID flags and why that's happening in a

247
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,630
little bit but there's so many people

248
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,860
you're probably not going to guess the

249
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,180
one that I'm talking about which is the

250
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,920
only reason that I'm allowing myself to

251
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,260
allude to this but at least one of the

252
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,680
people rather than simply disputing the

253
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,020
Content ID claims per the standard

254
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,480
operating procedure took their problem

255
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,820
public rather than just emailing me and

256
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,370
I know that at least one of these people

257
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,710
more than one actually more than one of

258
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,110
these people have my contact

259
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,730
information my personal contact

260
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,130
information from applying for a job at

261
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,709
Linus Media Group in the past one that

262
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,899
they obviously didn't get so I

263
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,610
disappointed I'm disappointed in the way

264
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,529
that some people have handled this

265
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,240
without just talking to me when they

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,760
obviously have my contact info which

267
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
hasn't changed in the entire time that

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Linus Media Group has exist existed and

269
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,680
I'm I I never win myself any friends

270
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
when I say stuff like this but that's

271
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,860
not really the goal of today's stream

272
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,019
I'm I'm a little disappointed in the

273
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,380
community you know not necessarily over

274
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,959
on the forum by and large the folks over

275
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,060
there have been more understanding and

276
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,709
have dug a little deeper for the facts

277
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,500
before raising their pitchforks but the

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,350
the YouTube viewer community more

279
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,209
broadly I've been disappointed in the

280
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,140
way that some individuals have just

281
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,360
assumed that I'm some kind of you know

282
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,579
wielder of you know the copyright been

283
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,910
hammer without any regard for fair use

284
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,240
or for smaller creators or that I'm some

285
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,570
kind of like anti-competitive asshole

286
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,680
like based on what evidence is this

287
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,170
assumption being made like am I

288
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,589
automatically evil for a problem with an

289
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,890
automated system that I don't control a

290
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,829
problem that was brought to my attention

291
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:38,860
literally on Friday morning or do we

292
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,670
live in a place where you are guilty and

293
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,029
guilty until proven innocent maybe

294
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,120
there's another way of saying that you

295
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
should be assumed innocent until proven

296
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,850
guilty

297
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,860
why don't we assume the best of people

298
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,370
until we are presented with

299
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,570
incontrovertible evidence that they are

300
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,800
actually acting out of malice so so so

301
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,320
then with that in mind what I'm gonna do

302
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,140
is I'm gonna take all of the vitriol

303
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,839
that I've been getting over the last

304
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,449
couple of days and I'm going to assume

305
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,790
that everyone who is dishing it out did

306
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,430
it out of ignorance rather than out

307
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,990
of some kind of ill-will so I want the

308
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,060
rest of the stream to be more about

309
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,750
educating people rather than sort of

310
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,839
complaining about the situation all

311
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:35,230
right

312
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,260
so someone on our forum actually did a

313
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,839
better job of this then I probably could

314
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,209
have it's an excellent post so what I'm

315
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,100
gonna do is I'm gonna read it out so

316
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,839
that you guys can fully understand the

317
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,600
difference between a Content ID claim

318
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,670
and a copyright strike because they are

319
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,339
spectacularly different so it was posted

320
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,529
by spotty over on our forum actually I

321
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,320
can hopefully this works I'm gonna

322
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
screen share with you guys yeah it looks

323
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,850
like it's working cool so spotty posted

324
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,410
in response to someone else you seem to

325
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,029
be misinformed there is a huge

326
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,040
difference between a copyright claim and

327
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,810
it take down notice resulting in a

328
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,140
copyright strike copyright claims which

329
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,000
was what happened to one of the people

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,510
that made a video are often actually as

331
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,910
far as I know they just are an automatic

332
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,550
process where content actually no no no

333
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,720
no no that's correct

334
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
often not always because we actually ran

335
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,550
into one that was on purpose a little r1

336
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,339
that was manual a little while ago we

337
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,440
included a few notes of a song in the

338
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,870
the cheap 4k TV video the video has

339
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,190
since been edited and we've got

340
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,750
monetization re-enabled on it but ya

341
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,540
know it can be manual so an often

342
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,160
Odyssey like I said spotty did it better

343
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,110
than I could often automatic process

344
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,120
where Content ID detects that a portion

345
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,790
of your copyrighted content has appeared

346
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,650
in another video on YouTube and will

347
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,140
issue a copyright claim on the video so

348
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,000
that video remains public and viewable

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,110
not all these viewable everywhere

350
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,089
because sometimes it will be blocked off

351
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,010
in like certain regions per the

352
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,579
copyright holders guidelines however

353
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,380
what happens after that point is that

354
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,630
any ad revenue generated by the video

355
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,480
may be redirected to the original

356
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,910
copyright holder so there's no actual

357
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,910
punishment for the channel when when

358
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,150
this Content ID copyright claim is made

359
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,579
against them they only lose the revenue

360
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,190
for the video

361
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,040
okay so now that we've got all that

362
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
obviously this is not a perfect solution

363
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,790
because what if someone

364
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,910
what if someone submitted a mash-up of

365
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,770
youtuber reaction videos and then all

366
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,930
you know nine of the people in the 3x3

367
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,790
tile of reacting to whatever it is are

368
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,750
eight I guess it would because the

369
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,160
original content would be in the middle

370
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,620
what if they all submitted Content ID

371
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,540
claims well I don't know how you split

372
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,710
something anyways I don't think it's

373
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,910
actually about granular so it's

374
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,380
obviously not a perfect system and

375
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,270
there's a lot of room for false

376
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,840
positives but there's no punishment for

377
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,850
the channel there's no long term impact

378
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,370
just the revenue and just on that

379
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,280
particular video now copyright strikes

380
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,460
or takedown notices so this is this is

381
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,230
like DMCA stuff

382
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,810
that's what the verge did to Kyle okay

383
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,170
so that's when the copyright owner

384
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,790
manually issues a legal notice that the

385
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,380
video is infringing on their copyright

386
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,960
and they demand that the video be

387
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,180
removed from the platform so the channel

388
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,420
then receives a strike against their

389
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,160
channel which comes with punishments

390
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,900
such as losing the ability to livestream

391
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,790
just one strike and you can't livestream

392
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,100
anymore and can even come with the

393
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,890
potential to be demoted in terms of

394
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,100
YouTube's YouTube serving your content

395
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,150
to people though I don't think that's

396
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,790
ever actually been confirmed and then

397
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,460
after multiple copyright strikes so

398
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,650
remember this is DMCA takedowns the

399
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,480
channel can be removed completely I

400
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,329
think it's three right before don't

401
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,900
quote me on that Ben so that that's

402
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,620
really different and that is not what is

403
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,480
happening right now so what's happening

404
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,540
is Content ID claims and what is not

405
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,569
happening is manual DMCA takedowns so

406
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,819
Content ID claims are handled by YouTube

407
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,750
algorithmically

408
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,480
so our MCN full screen is making sure

409
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,740
that people aren't real plotting our

410
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,180
videos because that does actually happen

411
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,520
a lot and that way we don't have to pull

412
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,780
all that crap down and go through it

413
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,250
manually fill out a bunch of annoying

414
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,170
paperwork just if people reload our

415
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,200
videos we just take the Adsense fine who

416
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,860
cares no big deal the only times that we

417
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,560
have issued DMCA takedowns are for

418
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,640
people who are up

419
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,920
loading content that is supposed to be

420
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,340
on other sites such as hold on mixed

421
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,010
messaging oh I didn't mean to do that

422
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,090
Thank You Nick um there we go so let's

423
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,040
go back to that how was I talking about

424
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,240
right okay so there was something that I

425
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:16,270
wanted to add so Content ID on top of it

426
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,620
not having any long-term ramifications

427
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,260
for the channel aside from just losing

428
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,090
the revenue on that video if you believe

429
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,130
for whatever reason that that Content ID

430
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,830
claim is not valid

431
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,660
you can dispute it and I'm actually

432
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,190
gonna walk you guys through the process

433
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,380
for how to dispute a Content ID claim

434
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,120
I'll show you I'm gonna dispute one on

435
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,960
my channel right now if you dispute it

436
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,060
in a timely manner it actually doesn't

437
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,160
even affect the monetization of the

438
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,560
video either so it's some period of days

439
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,690
like you don't have to do it ten minutes

440
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,160
after you get it but I also wouldn't

441
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,110
wait for a week or a month or whatever

442
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,870
else but if you do it right away then

443
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,090
there is literally no impact whatsoever

444
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,040
other than to help train the YouTube

445
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,940
algorithm so let's go ahead and fire up

446
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,000
here we go hopefully I am doing all this

447
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,670
correctly yeah seems fine okay so let's

448
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,960
fire up a video here we've actually

449
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,320
gotten a ton of Content ID claims over

450
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,840
the last probably I'd say week or so

451
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,000
including some from our own channels

452
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,750
against our own channels just because I

453
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,790
is my belief that they have made some

454
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,740
changes to the Content ID system making

455
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,870
a little bit more sensitive it's again

456
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,370
my belief I don't have any proof of this

457
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,350
but that it is due to the ongoing

458
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,330
chapter 13 stuff that's going on in the

459
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,630
EU but I've disputed most of them so

460
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,100
you'll see that most of these aren't

461
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,680
really that new so this was streamed in

462
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,230
last November includes copyrighted

463
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,940
content so we go ahead and we click on

464
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,880
this okay

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,380
it says ads might appear on your video

466
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,330
copyrighted content was found in your

467
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,070
video the claimant is allowing their

468
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,470
content to be used in your YouTube video

469
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,440
however ads might appear on it if you

470
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,050
agree with these conditions you don't

471
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,470
have to do

472
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,140
anything monetized by claimant you can

473
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,460
use the copyrighted content your video

474
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,929
but ads might appear in your video okay

475
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,370
so we can learn more just go ahead and

476
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,130
let me learn some more what is a Content

477
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,720
ID claim if you upload a video that

478
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,400
contains copyright protected material

479
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,020
you could end up with a Content ID claim

480
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,880
companies that are music movies TV shows

481
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
video games another copyright protected

482
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,990
material content owners can set content

483
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,250
had to eat a block material from YouTube

484
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,690
when a claim is may they can also allow

485
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,730
the video to remain live on YouTube with

486
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,409
ads in those cases the revenue goes to

487
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,490
the copyright owners of the claimed

488
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,820
content okay am I in trouble

489
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,980
probably not in most cases getting a

490
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,750
Content ID claim isn't a bad thing for

491
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,010
your YouTube channel it just means hey

492
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,570
we found some content your video that's

493
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,190
owned by someone else it's up to the

494
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,600
copyright owners to decide whether or

495
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,159
not others can reuse their original

496
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,990
material in many cases they allow their

497
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,549
content to be used in YouTube videos in

498
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,929
exchange for having ads run on those

499
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,850
videos these ads may play before the

500
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,240
video or during it bla bla bla alright

501
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,799
they can mute it they can block certain

502
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,630
platforms they can block a video what

503
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,280
can I do about this claim if you get a

504
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,419
Content ID claim there are a few

505
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:02,650
different things you can do depending on

506
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,570
the situation you can do nothing if you

507
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,250
agree but yeah I probably shouldn't use

508
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,440
that you can leave it and you can always

509
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,179
change your mind later you can remove

510
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:14,049
the music so that's cool you can swap

511
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,880
the music you can share revenue if

512
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,049
you're a member of the YouTube Partner

513
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,480
Program you may be able to share revenue

514
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,039
with the music rights owner I actually

515
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,390
did not know about that it's kind of

516
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,159
neat you can dispute the claim if you

517
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,480
have the required rights to use the

518
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,039
copyright protected content your video

519
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
or if you think the system has somehow

520
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,150
misidentified your video you may dispute

521
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,370
the claim so how to dispute a claim you

522
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,179
go to let's go back to where we were

523
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,590
okay oh yeah first we can check and see

524
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,600
what exactly it is so in this case it

525
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,419
was oh it was a trailer for some Pokemon

526
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:45,220
thing or other oh we were doing live

527
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,890
commentary so yes this is copyrighted

528
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,890
content but it's a trailer which is

529
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,330
generally considered to be for

530
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,940
promotional purposes it's very unlikely

531
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,960
that a copyright holder would be mad at

532
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,990
you for playing their trailer and

533
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,309
talking about it that's kind of like

534
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,100
what the point of them is also where

535
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,470
we're commenting on it that's pretty

536
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,960
pretty well established to be a fair use

537
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,730
use case for it so we're gonna file a

538
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,299
dispute

539
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,549
I believe this copyright claim is not

540
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:16,270
valid

541
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,340
here's a few options I beheld the cd/dvd

542
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,140
or bought the song online by the way if

543
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,280
you click that if that's your reason

544
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,360
you're wrong

545
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,250
I gave credit in the video if you click

546
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,350
that that's your reason you're wrong the

547
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,940
video is my original content I own all

548
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,929
the rights yep

549
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,670
sometimes it just Flags random crap we

550
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,750
we actually had a claim against an actor

551
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,220
April Fool's video we uploaded where it

552
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,080
was just a case lying in the rain and it

553
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,120
was just the sound of rain and there was

554
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,030
a claim that that we had used someone

555
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,860
else's rain sound effect we were like yo

556
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,210
let's no it's just our microphone

557
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,059
sitting on the porch no so that was that

558
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,190
was all our original content here's

559
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,300
another one I have license for

560
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,210
permission to use this material okay my

561
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,679
use of the content meets the legal

562
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,300
requirements for fair use or fair

563
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,860
dealing under applicable copyright laws

564
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,960
that's the one we're going to use here

565
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,059
or the content is in the public domain

566
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:05,290
and not eligible for copyright

567
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,250
protection so these are all the reasons

568
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,290
you can say that that it's fine to use

569
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,059
it so here we go in the case of the

570
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,950
heaven benchmark which was what I think

571
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,630
a lot of people are getting flagged on

572
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,429
we don't own that and as far as I know

573
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,320
Unigine gives zero FS about people

574
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,760
uploading their benchmark content

575
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,929
they've never talked to us about it and

576
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,730
we've got probably hours of it in our

577
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,500
videos which is probably why other

578
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,260
people are getting claims because like

579
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,559
we uploaded it a lot and quite early on

580
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,900
and it's just it you have to submit

581
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,210
these reports otherwise the system can't

582
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,059
fix itself now I can understand where a

583
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,830
lot of people whoops

584
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,960
I just hit a hotkey that's not a thing

585
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,670
good there we go I can understand why a

586
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,800
lot of people would find the wording of

587
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,700
what would be the correct response here

588
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,150
kind of scary

589
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,340
my use of the content meets the legal

590
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,840
requirements for fair use or fair

591
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,309
dealing under applicable copyright laws

592
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,050
that's a scary thing to click because it

593
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,540
feels like you should probably consult a

594
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,890
lawyer before you click on something

595
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,150
like that

596
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,730
but that's not necessarily the case you

597
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,500
know what I would say is make sure that

598
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,530
you at the very least I would say that

599
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,900
at the at the very least you should you

600
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,030
know probably read up on what went down

601
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,809
with h3h3 productions and that person

602
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,270
they made a reaction video of a lot of

603
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,070
good material there there was a lawyer

604
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,680
that actually did a bunch of content

605
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,100
sort of around that very educational I

606
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,870
would like at least gogo read up on that

607
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,780
but no not not necessarily I mean fair

608
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,280
fair use in some cases is pretty

609
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,540
cut-and-dried whereas in other cases

610
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,460
yeah you you might actually end up in

611
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,590
court trying to defend it so a lot of

612
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,210
the time yeah it's probably better off

613
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,560
to just leave it which is why you'll see

614
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,020
we do actually have here if I go back to

615
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,920
the dashboard oh no I'm not gonna go

616
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,060
back to the dashboard yet you know what

617
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,670
I'm gonna finish my I'm gonna finish my

618
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,200
my dispute here okay

619
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,660
I believe this is not valid because my

620
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,720
use blah blah blah fair use etc yep

621
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,560
continue I'm quite sure about this a

622
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,090
visual content please explain briefly we

623
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,890
are commenting on this trailer I believe

624
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,650
this is fair use I have in good faith

625
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,170
etc etc etc thank you I understand well

626
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,880
that's my name continue and we can

627
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,790
submit our dispute yes yes I'm sure so

628
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,950
the process takes about 30 seconds and

629
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,650
if you if you do these things you're

630
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,630
actually helping them make the Content

631
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,490
ID system better because if they get a

632
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,210
bunch of disputes then they can go back

633
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,270
and they can say oh right okay so that's

634
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,650
probably not right let's go ahead and

635
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,460
get that updated um so there you go

636
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,420
dispute in progress

637
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,830
typically these take a couple of days

638
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,440
for my experience but that is that is

639
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,710
the entire process hopefully that was

640
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,260
illuminating for y'all I think there was

641
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,280
a thing I said I was going to get back

642
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,690
to I forget what it was but let's go

643
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,100
back to my notes here yeah actually you

644
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,330
know what no I think that's pretty much

645
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,170
all I have to say on the subject if

646
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,110
anyone out there did get a Content ID

647
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,870
claim from - Media Group - tech tips any

648
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,260
of its affiliated whatever unless you're

649
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,650
actually just reloading our videos which

650
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,680
you're not supposed to do I would say

651
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,600
just dispute it the worst thing that

652
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,070
could possibly happen is we could say

653
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,990
nope we dispute your dispute

654
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,980
we disagree I never done that it's just

655
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,920
not really a thing people upload all

656
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,860
kinds of like highlight reels or silly

657
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,930
reuses of of limas media group content

658
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,970
you know set to songs or like whatever

659
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,310
we love that kind of stuff we love our

660
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,850
community memeing it up we we consider

661
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,870
ourselves a fairly internet savvy

662
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,610
company and not just like the internet

663
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,670
but also just oh all right Nick yeah

664
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,740
thanks Nick Nick told me what I was what

665
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,270
I was showing I was gonna show a thing

666
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,710
that wasn't worth disputing but we

667
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,000
consider ourselves not just like how the

668
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,620
internet works a V would also internet

669
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,020
culture savvy and we recognize that you

670
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,650
know memes and discussion about us is

671
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,690
it's just it's good if people want to

672
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,150
just like have fun with us and engage

673
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,370
with us that way it's great I've gotten

674
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,640
many many and everything from smile to

675
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,650
full-on laugh from the kinds of things

676
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,910
that our community has done with our

677
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,050
content and I love it so yeah I just

678
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,560
submit a dispute it'll probably be fine

679
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,790
so Nick reminded me what I had said I

680
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,340
was going to do I was going to show some

681
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,470
of the copyright notices that I

682
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,470
considered not worth disputing some of

683
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,760
these were left this one was left in

684
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,160
here just because it's like Rancho

685
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,810
Rancho doesn't really like make any

686
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,000
money on Adsense anyway like after the

687
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,950
first week or so it doesn't get any view

688
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,860
so what am I like what am i bothering

689
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,600
for it's like it's not worth the 30

690
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,860
seconds it takes me to dispute the

691
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,260
stupid thing but some of these I left

692
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,470
because there is actually potential

693
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,580
legal ramifications if I dispute it and

694
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,290
they decide they don't like my dispute

695
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,390
and they they want to they want to go to

696
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,370
court over whether it's fair you so this

697
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,470
I think is an example of that the

698
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,710
fallout 4 ultimate bomb case build log

699
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,850
so here we used some kind of classical

700
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,280
music apparently yeah so this is like

701
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,860
music stuff which from our experience is

702
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,900
super complicated because there's

703
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,330
different copyrights for the actual

704
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:57,779
sheet

705
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,139
music itself and the performance and it

706
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,149
varies from country to country and we

707
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:04,559
were just like this was around the time

708
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,169
that we were just like you know what

709
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,149
screw it we're just gonna like pay the

710
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,429
thousands and thousands of dollars that

711
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:13,529
it costs to subscribe to a service like

712
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,330
Warner Chappell and we're just gonna

713
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,809
gonna invest in having music for our oh

714
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,099
I'm parent Lee I'm not showing you guys

715
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:20,969
the screen right now

716
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,080
sorry Thank You Nick what would I do

717
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,389
without you're my guardian angel so here

718
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,719
you go

719
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,340
so they'll fall out for ultimate bomb

720
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,719
build there you go so here's a bunch of

721
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,159
performances we were just like you know

722
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,239
what we're not gonna we're not gonna

723
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,889
deal with that we're just gonna we're

724
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:35,369
just gonna spend a lot the new one we're

725
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:36,869
on now is like evac forget which one it

726
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:38,700
is it's like even better than the

727
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,109
warner/chappell libraries we were using

728
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:43,109
but it's like I was like 15 grand a year

729
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:45,149
so I'm stupid like that's amazing how

730
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:48,950
much it costs to to do things properly

731
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,799
so this is an example of one that we're

732
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,049
just we're just gonna leave if they want

733
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,969
the you know a few hundred bucks or

734
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,710
whatever then I guess they're they're

735
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,229
welcome to it going back there's just

736
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:02,639
like some older stuff that I just didn't

737
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:04,589
bother with as well but I'm glad I

738
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:05,729
didn't bother with all of them because

739
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:08,009
at least it means that I had this to

740
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:11,309
show you wonderful people how to dispute

741
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,599
a Content ID claim I guess right before

742
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,619
I go I should probably see if there's

743
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,359
any like chats or anything that I should

744
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,950
deal with

745
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,690
mostly just people being nice supportive

746
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,720
well that's kind of amazing

747
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,179
a couple people just want a summary of

748
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,710
the issue since they tuned in a little

749
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,510
bit later in this dream okay so

750
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,250
basically people have been getting

751
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,620
Content ID claims not to be confused

752
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,730
with copyright strikes from lionís Media

753
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,650
Group they're from fullscreen on behalf

754
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,770
of Lynas Media Group these have been

755
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,410
false content ID matches a lot of them

756
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,610
on the heaven benchmark not although and

757
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,130
people think and a bunch of pitchforks

758
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,480
are being raised and torches and all

759
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,309
that that - Media Group is you know

760
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,010
trying to keep down smaller creators or

761
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,140
whatever totally not a thing not what

762
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,730
happened it's an automated system we

763
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,169
believe it's gotten some updates lately

764
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,320
and disputing Content ID claims is super

765
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,200
easy I showed earlier on this stream how

766
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,419
you do it as long as as you don't think

767
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,070
the original copyright holder doesn't

768
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,809
have a claim to it either it's pretty

769
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,730
safe to go ahead and just dispute those

770
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,220
things it's really not a lot that can go

771
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,230
wrong it has no long-term impact on your

772
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,000
channel so it's all good we just all

773
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,120
need to have less drama and you know

774
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,530
give people the benefit of the doubt if

775
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,820
we have a problem with them we need to

776
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,059
reach out from directly I'm actually

777
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,559
shockingly easy to get ahold of I do

778
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,190
ignore the vast majority of the tweets

779
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,470
that get sent to my handle just because

780
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,480
like the last time I opened the Twitter

781
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,450
app was on Friday when I was at work

782
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,990
because I don't actually Twitter because

783
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,380
I like it i twitter because it's my job

784
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,700
boo there's there's a there's a

785
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,000
bombshell confession you know if you

786
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,470
send it to my email the business

787
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,169
inquiries only email we can't we

788
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,659
actually cannot reply to every email

789
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:23,690
that comes to that we reply to the

790
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,640
business inquiries what we do do though

791
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,289
is read them all so if there's something

792
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,330
that we are getting a ton of messages

793
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,580
about then we will address it in some

794
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,559
other way I just mean we're easy to get

795
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,640
in touch with even if you don't

796
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,270
necessarily get a response and hopefully

797
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,320
we've demonstrated

798
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,130
so that's unless Nikki's got something

799
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,390
else urgent that he feels like I need to

800
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,340
address I'm not a legal professional

801
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,330
Thank You Nick

802
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,610
that's very very helpful for me to point

803
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,260
out to everyone that's all I've got to

804
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,420
say on the subject there's no doubt that

805
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,480
drama sells and I'm not above monetizing

806
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,680
the video you guys are watching right

807
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,530
now and my if I'm gonna get sucked into

808
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,870
this thing I might as well you know make

809
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,810
a couple of shekels and you know go buy

810
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,220
some new video games to play tonight

811
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,450
while I relax but I have zero appetite

812
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,700
for continuing to follow up on this

813
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,560
I'm only even making this as a

814
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,600
standalone video rather than addressing

815
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,520
it on the LAN show because the episode

816
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,860
of the LAN show from Friday which should

817
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,560
be up and contains my response to this

818
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,220
is still down due to a technical issue

819
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,330
on youtubes end so here we are

820
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,820
fortunately YouTube streaming worked for

821
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,570
me for a continuous however however long

822
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,700
